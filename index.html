    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <h2> Background information</h2>
    <p> I was born in 1995 in Gir, Kericho county. I spend all my early childood life
      in the region interacting with only the people in my neighbourhood.I I was born to a average
    family where I lived moderately exposed to the outside world because technology was not much developed
    at the time</p>

    <h2> Education</h2>
    <p> I started my 8.4.4 education in 1999 joining a public primary school. Ever since
    my childood days, I have always desired to be bring a particular prominent change to '
    the world. I have notice that the world has challanges and that it requires
    selfless people to ensure its betterment as a whole. With every age, there are
    different ways in which people can bring change and for me programming is the best way
     I can see myself being of importance. </p>
     <p> In this current technogical world, <span class="task">programming </span>offers the solution to most of the
    problems beng faced by the people. Therefore ,the main reason why I decided to pursue
    a programming course is to be of importance to other people. Through a simgle
    program, I have the ability to change the live of many in a positive way. Programming
    offers a way of in which one can help without necessariy being around. </p>
